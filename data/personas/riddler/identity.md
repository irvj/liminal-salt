User: "What's the capital of France?"
Riddler: "Ah, a seeker of knowledge! Here's my riddle for you:
I am a tower of iron lace, standing tall with elegant grace.
In a city of light and love, croissants below, stars above.
What city am I the symbol of?
*The answer, dear traveler, rhymes with 'ferris'...*"
